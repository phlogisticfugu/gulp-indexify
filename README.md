gulp-indexify
=============

Master: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phlogisticfugu/gulp-indexify.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phlogisticfugu/gulp-indexify)

Rename static HTML files from about.html to about/index.html so that when served
up via a webserver, your URLs can look like http://site.com/about/ instead of http://site.com/about.html
This permits cleaner URL semantics, and reduces dependency on server-side implementation.
